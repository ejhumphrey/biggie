# Biggie #

A module for managing notoriously big data.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `biggie` is with pip:

```
$ pip install git+git://github.com/ejhumphrey/biggie.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and do it the hard way:

```
$ cd ~/to/a/good/place
$ git clone https://github.com/ejhumphrey/biggie.git
$ cd biggie
$ python setup.py build
$ [sudo] python setup.py install
```

## Testing your install

Clone the repository and run the tests directly; `nose` is recommended, and installed as a dependency:

```
$ cd {wherever_you_cloned_it}/biggie
$ nosetests
```
